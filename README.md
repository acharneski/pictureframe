# Desktop Printing Scalable Posters via Hexagon Tiling

Using a combination of 3d printing and conventional printing with a desktop color laser printer and a moderately high-volume desktop 3d FFD printer, we produce framing structures that can be mounted on walls and used to magnetically hold hexagonal picture tiles.

This project include a scala utility to slice any image into hexagonal tiles. It currently assumes that the image space wraps around as in a tilable texture, but can be set to only tile the area within a single image (i.e. non-repeating).

Included in the samples directory is an infinitely-tileable generated texture generated by my previous research.
